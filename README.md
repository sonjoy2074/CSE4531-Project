# MedSecureNet: MRI Image-Based Tumor Detection with End-to-End Encrypted and Federated Learning
The healthcare industry increasingly relies on technology to assist in diagnostics, but this comes with significant privacy and security challenges. Patients trust healthcare providers with sensitive information, and breaches of this trust can have severe legal and ethical consequences. Current centralized systems, like cloud-based AI models, are vulnerable to hacking, unauthorized access and data misuse.

## Problem Statement
How can we securely transmit and analyze MRI images while protecting patient privacy, ensuring data integrity and maintaining high-quality predictions without relying on centralized storage or computation?

## Dataset 
We used the [**Brain Tumor MRI Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset?select=Training) by **Masoud Nickparvar** for training and testing the model.

**Dataset Overview:**  
- **Type:** MRI Images  
- **Classes:**  
  - Glioma  
  - Meningioma 
  - No Tumor  
  - Pituitary 
- **Format:** Image files (JPEG/PNG)
